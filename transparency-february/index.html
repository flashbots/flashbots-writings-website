This was an inevitability, but the timeline has accelerated. Will miners pick the democratic, transparent, fair, and efficient path to MEV extraction, or seek to extract on their own in a permissioned manner? We will soon find out‚Ä¶</p><p><em>On Jan 6, we launched Flashbots Alpha, our market-based alternative to unilateral trader-miner collusion for the extraction of MEV. Flashbots is a two-sided marketplace composed of miners and MEV searchers. Any miner or mining pool can run MEV-geth and receive additional income from MEV strictly more than what it would earn from running vanilla geth, without the need to enter into any bespoke deal with traders. MEV searchers, predominantly bot operators, are able to send transactions through a Flashbots gateway called MEV-relay to improve chance of landing on-chain without the need to pay for gas on failed transaction, or causing chain congestion and enter into gas war that hurts other Ethereum users.</em></p><p>At the time of writing, there are <strong>5 mining pools</strong> running MEV-geth, collectively accounting for over <strong>12%</strong> of total Ethereum hashrate, collecting <strong>0.13ETH</strong> per block of additional MEV revenue from Flashbots transaction bundles. On the MEV searcher side, we are seeing a 3x increase in unique searchers who have successfully landed bundles on chain.</p><p>This post constitutes our second monthly update to shed light on the activity happening on Flashbots, as part of our ongoing efforts in fulfilling Flashbots‚Äô commitment to iterate in the public. In addition to open-sourcing our codebase, and providing monthly progress updates via MEV Roasts and Flashbots Community Calls, this Transparency Update aims to review the searcher and miner activity on Flashbots core infrastructure.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="novel-use-cases-of-flashbots"></a>Novel Use Cases of Flashbots<a class="hash-link" href="#novel-use-cases-of-flashbots" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="account-abstraction"></a>Account Abstraction<a class="hash-link" href="#account-abstraction" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>An accidental use case for flashbots was discovered: account abstraction. The creative use cases of Flashbots in the rescue of compromised Cryptokitties and ENS in January has inspired the community to come up with research ideas and experimental implementations.</p><p>Since Flashbots allows for submitting zero gas transactions, it‚Äôs also possible to submit transactions which are paid for with any ERC20 token. This is commonly referred to as ‚Äúaccount abstraction‚Äù or ‚Äúsponsored transactions‚Äù. Flashbots in-house white hat Scott open-sourced a sample searcher which makes it easy to execute sponsored transactions. EIP-3074 has been proposed for the next hardfork which is poised to play well with our system.</p><p>Vitalik also chimed in on how Flashbots can be used as a backdoor path to account abstraction.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/transparency-february-1-0abfc90da449c128f063c018ff344019.png"></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="community-experiments"></a>Community Experiments<a class="hash-link" href="#community-experiments" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Community is an integral part of the Flashbots ecosystem.

We now require all bundles to be signed with an ethereum private key which allows us to start tracking a searcher‚Äôs reputation. This reputation could in the future be used to provide a priority channel for high reputation searchers as suggested here. You can find out more about this change here.</p><p><strong>Bundle Simulation</strong> ‚Äî We added an <code>eth_callBundle</code> RPC to MEV-relay in order to help searchers debug their bundle execution. By default, this RPC allows for simulating the execution of an arbitrary bundle up to 64 blocks in the past. You can find out more about this new feature here. Bundle simulation was added to both the ethers.js and web3.py flashbots libraries (thanks to 0xVerif !)</p><p><strong>MEV-explore v0</strong> ‚Äî We released the v0 of MEV-explore to explore.flashbots.net and received great feedback on how we can continue to improve data accuracy. We were able to pruned several false positives which inflated the initial numbers. Thanks to Ankur for his contributions here. Next steps will be to add Flashbots specific metrics within the dashboard!</p><p><strong>Flashbots Forum</strong> ‚Äî Over the course of February, our efforts were focused on improving the UX for searchers and miners. As part of this effort, we created a new forum on github to aggregate feature requests and provide technical support. If you have any suggestions or questions, please direct them there and help us identify the most important discussions by voting up and down!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="searcher-adoption"></a>Searcher Adoption<a class="hash-link" href="#searcher-adoption" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="2x-bundle-inclusion"></a>2x bundle inclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#2x-bundle-inclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Despite not increasing the amount of hashrate in February compared to January, there was 2x the number of successfully mined flashbots bundles.

It is usually at the core of Flashbots criticism and we do not shy away from it. At Flashbots, we strongly believe the systems we build must exhibit credible neutrality if we wish to be successful in mitigating the bigger MEV crisis. We believe the infrastructure we build must optimize for both fairness and economic optimality if it is to be resilient in the long run. Censorship of any arbitrary strategy would create an economic incentive for less moral actors to deviate from a democratic solution. As such, we are forced to take a research driven stance on what is ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù MEV. We refer to this as an ‚ÄúMEV Taxonomy‚Äù which we are helping define at the core of our research agenda. We cannot be the enforcers, but are working hard to provide the education, transparency, and tools necessary for the community to establish their own norms and be able to enforce them.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="miner-participation"></a>Miner Participation<a class="hash-link" href="#miner-participation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="a-wild-miner-appears"></a>A wild miner appears<a class="hash-link" href="#a-wild-miner-appears" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Several new miners have been hard at work integrating MEV-geth over the course of February and have come online in early March.

This is a delicate topic and while we aim to remain neutral in discussing potential adoption of the standard, EIP-1559 has become a catalyst for miner awareness of MEV.</p><p>Indeed, for many solo-miners the EIP1559 community call was the first introduction to MEV and its implications for miner profitability.</p><p>[embed missing]</p><p>The first thing to understand is that not all ethereum transactions are created equal. Regular ethereum transactions bid for ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù where they can be included anywhere in a block, while MEV transactions bid for ‚Äúpriority‚Äù where they want to be included only in specific block positions (often the first in the block).</p><p>Under the current EIP1559 proposal, ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù fees are burned as the basefee while ‚Äúpriority‚Äù fees are sent to the miner as a tip. This means everything hangs on this question: How do ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù fees compare to ‚Äúpriority‚Äù fees in the long run?</p><p>As shown by MEV-explore, MEV is already a significant driver of transaction flow on the network. This is because priority positions in a block are much more scarce than inclusion positions. Over time, we expect mining fees derived from MEV to greatly exceed mining fees derived from regular ethereum transaction.</p><p>Miners looking to maximize their fees will adopt MEV extraction systems like MEV-geth regardless of whether EIP1559 is adopted.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/transparency-february-6-d43c5d709a52f044e06c0aa96674d3f1.png"></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="solo-miners-and-flashbots"></a>Solo miners and Flashbots<a class="hash-link" href="#solo-miners-and-flashbots" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Flashbots organization maintains MEV-geth which provides a simple way for miners to maximize their revenues from MEV / priority transactions.</p><p>Revenues generated from MEV have high variance (ie. they are not distributed equally between blocks), and therefore the likelihood of a solo miner mining a Flashbots block is extremely low.</p><p>The Flashbots system is still in ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù release which unfortunately means it has some limitations.
