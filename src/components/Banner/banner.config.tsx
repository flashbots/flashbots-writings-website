/* Custom Banner Module
Use it to quickly deploy a simple banner to the Flashbots homepage

To add a new banner all you need to do is edit the properties below and set them
to your desired values.

For simple banners with just a couple of colors - for copy and background - you
can use the properties here. But if the banner requires more sophisticated styling
you can override the color options by setting `customCSS: true` and adding your CSS
rules to ./Banner.custom.module.scss.

There are detailed explanations for each property below, but here's a quick guide:
 - bannerContent: What should appear inside the banner
 - backgroundColor: Solid, single color for the banner
 - textColor: Solid, single color for all the copy inside the banner
 - startDate: When should the banner start appearing on the site
 - endDate: When should the banner stop appearing on the site
 - customCSS: Whether the banner should make use of custom CSS rules loaded from ./Banner.custom.module.scss
