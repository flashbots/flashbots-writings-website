Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains. We propose a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction to preserve the ideals of Ethereum.
In this article, we discuss the details of the Flashbots organization and the initial projects on our research roadmap, MEV-Inspect and MEV-Geth.
