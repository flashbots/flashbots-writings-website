A competitive, geographically diverse, and transparent builder ecosystem is critical for the health of Ethereum. Flashbots has open sourced our leading [builder](https://github.com/flashbots/builder) in order to help this ecosystem grow further.
 
Competition among builders maximizes validators rewards and improves censorship resistance for users. With Suave, we envision an ecosystem of builders collaboratively building the most profitable block, each contributing a part of a block instead of one entity building the entire block. Open sourcing our builder will accelerate this future and promote competition in the market today.

As with our [mev-boost relay](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay), we have licensed this code under [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), an aggressive copy-left license that requires derivatives to be developed in the open. We encourage all teams to develop their builders in the open, and for the community to only trust builders who act consistent with the AGPL norms of transparency and free software.
 
Join us in ensuring that Ethereum has a competitive ecosystem of builders and a healthy MEV ecosystem.
