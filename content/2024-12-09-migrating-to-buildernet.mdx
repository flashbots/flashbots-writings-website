Block building must be made decentralized, uncensorable, and neutral. To accelerate decentralization in block building, Flashbots has deprecated our centralized block builders and migrated our orderflow and refunds to [BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/).

BuilderNet will make Ethereum more resilient by introducing a neutral way for many parties to share orderflow and collaborate in building blocks. It will also create better user experiences by providing a fair and equal platform to trade, and using verifiable ordering rules and improved privacy techniques to keep users safe.

As of December 5 2024, Flashbots no longer operates centralized block builders on Ethereum. A few instances will remain as backups to ensure continuity of service in extraordinary situations during the BuilderNet alpha period.

We invite the community to join us in developing BuilderNet, and to accelerate decentralization and neutrality in block building.
