An open and efficient block building ecosystem is essential to Ethereum. In order to catalyze further innovation and collaboration in block building, Flashbots has open sourced [rbuilder](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder), our latest and most performant block builder written in Rust, and designed to work with Reth.

We believe that sharing the responsibility and benefits of advancing block building creates a positive sum game for all Ethereum stakeholders. rbuilder is designed to be developed and stewarded by the community, and open sourcing it will accelerate this future.

We encourage developers to contribute to rbuilder, all teams to develop their builders in the open, and the community to only trust builders who follow the norms of transparency and free software.
