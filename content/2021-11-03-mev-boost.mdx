This document outlines the design for a marketplace for block construction (often referred to as block proposer / block builder separation or PBS) compatible with the upcoming Ethereum merge fork. This trust based solution closely resembles the [current Flashbots auction design](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/overview) with modifications to enable solo staker participation without introducing changes to Ethereum consensus. This solution aims to bridge the gap to a [permissionless PBS design](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725) which should be strongly considered for the cleanup fork in order to improve decentralization.
