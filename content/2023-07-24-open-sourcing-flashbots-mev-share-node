Orderflow originators should be able to see and control how their transactions are processed by other actors in the MEV supply chain. Flashbots has open sourced our implementation of a [MEV-Share Node](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-node) in order to bring more transparency to orderflow auctions and their guarantees.

Transparency among orderflow processors enables other parties — including users, wallets, application developers, searchers, and builders — to make more educated decisions about what they integrate with and share.

We encourage all teams to develop their orderflow auctions in the open, and we advise the community to work with OFAs that follow the norms of free and open source software.

The Flashbots Node is one of several open source references and tools for MEV-Share, including:
1. [Protocol specifiction](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share)
2. [Client library](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-share-client-ts)
3. [Example](https://github.com/flashbots/simple-blind-arbitrage) [bots](https://github.com/flashbots/simple-limit-order-bot)

Join us in building a more decentralized and transparent MEV supply chain.
