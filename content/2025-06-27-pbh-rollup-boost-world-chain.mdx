[Priority Blockspace for Humans (PBH)](https://world.org/blog/engineering/introducing-pbh-priority-blockspace-for-humans) is now live on World Chain Mainnet. And, it is powered by Flashbot’s [Rollup-Boost](https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost). 

Faster, cheaper blockchains have led to more contested blockspace between humans, bots, and AI agents. Verifiable human-first blockspace gives real users priority access.

## A New Era of Blockspace

Efficient use of blockspace has become an important tenant for [scaling blockchains](https://writings.flashbots.net/mev-and-the-limits-of-scaling). As bots and agents increasingly compete with people onchain, specialized infrastructure is essential for decentralized, human-first systems. 

PBH and Rollup-Boost on World Mainnet creates a priority highway for verified users. Over 13 million World ID users, verified by the [Orb](https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/orb) from Tools for Humanity, now have access to top-of-block priority, making transactions smoother and fairer for real users.

## Rollup-Boost Powers PBH

Rollup-Boost was conceptualized by Flashbots and has grown into a community effort maximize the performance of [OP stack rollups](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/design-docs/blob/main/protocol/external-block-production.md). Rollup-Boost is now live on two OP stack chains, [Unichain](https://writings.flashbots.net/unichain-mainnet) and World, and is being piloted by other leading L2s in the OP ecosystem. 

Rollup-Boost simplifies block building infrastructure for L2s and introduces a range of features and tools to further customize ordering policies, provide revert protection, and more. Flashbots and other community contributors have rigorously tested Rollup-Boost, preparing the system for mainnet L2s. 

Two important testing milestones have been the development of Flashbots’ load testing tool, [Contender](https://github.com/flashbots/contender), and the completion of a [security audit](https://github.com/flashbots/rollup-boost/blob/main/docs/NM_0411_0491_Security_Review_World_Rollup_Boost.pdf) by Nethermind Security. We are continually improving Rollup-Boost, adding new features and performance benchmarks. We are excited to collaborate with Tools for Humanity and other contributors as we work towards deploying attestable ordering logic, public building policy disclosures, and sub-200ms confirmations with Flashblocks. 

## Rollup-Boost Community

World Mainnet is an important milestone for the Rollup-Boost community. You can explore the [Rollup-Boost community](https://github.com/flashbots/rollup-boost?tab=readme-ov-file) on github and learn more about how it is improving user experiences and providing more predictable and accessible transaction inclusion.
