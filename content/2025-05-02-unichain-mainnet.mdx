# Unichain x Rollup-Boost

**We are excited to announce Unichain is the first L2 to release Rollup-Boost and deploy TEE block building on mainnet!**

<!--truncate-->

[Rollup-Boost](https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost) upgrades the performance, programmability, and decentralization of L2s through an open marketplace for innovative extensions. Rollups become cheaper, faster, and more decentralized with Rollup-Boost. It gives L2s control and customizability over their block building modules to enable high-performance features such as fast confirmation times, strong user guarantees, and MEV internalization.

Through Rollup-Boost, L2s can upgrade to high-powered TEE block building for additional performance capabilities that will drive the next generation of Defi apps and accelerate the L2 roadmap.

Rollup-Boost on Unichain mainnet unlocks a few groundbreaking milestones on the L2 roadmap to decentralization:

1. Unichain is one of the first L2s with an external block builder – a major step towards decentralization
2. Unichain’s external block builder is operating in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a first of its kind on L2
3. Unichain is the first L2 to launch revert protection on mainnet

While blocks built in TEEs and verifiable priority ordering combine to give users increased confidence in their DeFi experience, one of the most important features of Rollup-Boost is built-in revert protection. Revert protection reduces friction for users, improves the efficiency of DeFi systems such as AMMs, and lowers the chance of a user paying for failed transactions.

Flashbots and Uniswap Labs will continue to research and develop new features for Unichain to make it the home for DeFi. The Unichain x Rollup-Boost roadmap includes 200ms Flashblocks and public attestations for TEE ordering verifiability.

## Testing Rollup-Boost on Unichain

Our engineering team strives to meet new challenges head on. Running the first external block builder for a L2 in a TEE is no small feat and our team developed a few critical tools for testing L2s in as realistic conditions as possible.

Blockchain client performance engineering requires both extensive expertise and it is relatively time-consuming and costly. Using [Contender](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/contender-upgrades-april-2025/4905), a testing tool that can reliably and repeatably simulate transactions and bundles on real-world chain state to produce realistic benchmarks, Flashbots was able to [benchmark](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zeroxbrock/official-contender-reports/blob/main/reports/unichain-sepolia_2025-04-25/report-25-25.html) time to inclusion, gas usage, and other critical metrics prior to going live on mainnet with Rollup-Boost.
