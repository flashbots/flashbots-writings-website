# Boost your MEV in Ethereum proof-of-stake

Calling all validators to test [`mev-boost`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost).

<!--truncate-->

From our [early explorations in Ethereum proof-of-stake](https://writings.flashbots.net/research/mev-eth2) we found that “MEV can increase validator rewards by 75.3%, or give an APR of 12.86% rather than a non-MEV APR of 7.35% from staking eth.” Any competitive validator will need access to MEV.

Introducing `mev-boost`, which gives all validators the ability to participate in MEV extraction. Using `mev-boost` validators can sell their blockspace to specialized block builders. We developed it in collaboration with the Ethereum developers and researchers. For more information, see [Why run mev-boost?](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/why-run-mevboost/)

Today, `mev-boost` is ready for testing, and we need you! If you’re a solo validator or node operator, *please help us test on the Kiln and Ropsten networks*. Let us work together so the infrastructure is ready for the merge, and validators can profit from MEV from their first block.

Follow this guide to run `mev-boost`, a consensus client and an execution client:

https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Testing

Please test it and provide feedback as [issues](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues). We will be sharing more guides as the other [Consensus Clients finish their implementations of the API](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost#consensus-clients-implementation-status). The roadmap, expected deliveries and estimated deadlines are described in [The Plan](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/The-Plan-(tm)). Join us in the [`mev-boost` repository](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/) while we explore the remaining [open research questions](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Research#open-questions) with all the relevant organizations in the ecosystem. If you have further questions, take a look at the [Frenquently Asked Questions](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

We thank all the contributors to this project from the consensus clients, Ethereum Foundation, the [Eth2 Working Group](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/announcing-eth2-working-group/), and other organizations from the ecosystem. In particular, we appreciate [lightclient](https://github.com/lightclient/) for his leadership on the specification definition.

Looking forward to the next steps in the plan, we will be prototyping the addition of more independent block builders. If you are a member of an organization interested in running a builder, [tell us more](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/145)!
