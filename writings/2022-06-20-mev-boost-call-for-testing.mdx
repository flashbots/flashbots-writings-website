# Boost your MEV in Ethereum proof-of-stake

Calling all validators to test `mev-boost` in the Kiln test network.

<!--truncate-->

`mev-boost` mitigates the MEV crisis in Ethereum proof-of-stake and delivers to the validators a fair portion of the value generated by searchers extracting MEV opportunities. Read more on [Why run mev-boost?](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/why-run-mevboost/)

This is the next step on our exploration towards a trustless and decentralized MEV market. It is a service developed in collaboration with the Ethereum developers and researchers.

From our [early explorations in Ethereum proof-of-stake](https://writings.flashbots.net/research/mev-eth2) we found that “MEV can increase validator rewards by 75.3%, or give an APR of 12.86% rather than a non-MEV APR of 7.35% from staking eth.”

We are calling all validators to run `mev-boost` in the Kiln test network. We want to make sure that our infrastructure is ready for the merge, and that the validators are ready to profit from MEV since their first block.

Follow this guide to run teku+nethermind+mev-boost in Kiln:

Please test it and provide feedback as [issues](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues). We will be sharing more guides as the other [Consensus Clients finish their implementations of the API](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost#consensus-clients-implementation-status).

`mev-boost` works as a sidecar. It allows any consensus layer client to outsource block construction to third party block builders. If anything goes wrong on the workflow that optimizes for MEV fair distribution, the consensus clients run by the validators will just switch to get a simple block from an execution client and the public mempool, avoiding missing slots.

The roadmap, expected deliveries and estimated deadlines are described in [The Plan](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/The-Plan-(tm)). Join us in the [`mev-boost` repository](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/) while we explore the remaining [open research questions](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Research#open-questions) with all the relevant organizations in the ecosystem. If you have further questions, take a look at the [Frenquently Asked Questions](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

We thank all the contributors to this project from the consensus clients, Ethereum Foundation, the [Eth2 working group](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/announcing-eth2-working-group/), and other organizations from the ecosystem. In particular, we appreciate [lightclient](https://github.com/lightclient/) for his leadership on the specification definition.

Looking forward to the next steps in the plan, we will be prototyping the addition of more independent block builders. If you are a member of an organization interested in running a builder, [tell us more](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/145)!
