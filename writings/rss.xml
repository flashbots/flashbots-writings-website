            <description><![CDATA[Flashbots has been critical to leveling the MEV playing field on Proof-of-Work (PoW) Ethereum (eth1), and aims to bring the same benefits to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum (eth2). The adoption of Flashbots involves two distinct parties, block producers, and MEV searchers. In Ethereum, over 90% of miners have adopted Flashbots; however, as we approach eth2 and the transition to PoS, adoption will reset to 0. As such, for the health of the Ethereum ecosystem, it is imperative that validators also adopt an MEV solution for Ethereum post-merge. To assist in this adoption, we are pleased to announce the Flashbots Eth2 Working Group.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The beating heart of every blockchain is how space is allocated within a block. In less than 24 hours, Ethereum will undergo a historic change to how blockspace is allocated as transaction inclusion rules drastically change with the activation of EIP-1559. However, EIP-1559 does not affect miners’ ability to reorder, insert, or censor transactions, and as such it largely does not have an impact on MEV (Maximal Extractable Value).]]></description>
