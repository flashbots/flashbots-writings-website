We released v0.2 on May 24th with these features:</p><ul><li><p><em>Bundle merging (full-release)</em>: More revenue for miners, higher chance of inclusion for searchers.</p></li><li><p><em>New geth config introducing strict profit switching (optional, full-release)</em>: Eliminates empty block race condition (i.e. mining 2 gwei transaction), but increases latency hence may impact profitability.</p></li></ul><p>We ultimately decided to remove the following features:</p><ul><li><p><em>Proxy payment contract</em>: this feature was originally designed to enable better logging and to enable future solutions that attempted to prevent time bandit attacks. It was removed after receiving feedback from the searcher community that the proxy payment contract would add additional costs without providing finality guarantees.</p></li><li><p><em>Full block submission</em>: this feature was removed from the v0.2 release in order to reduce the complexity of the release.</p></li><li><p><em>Replace HTTP endpoints with WebSockets (full-release)</em>: this feature was removed to reduce complexity of v0.2</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="release-v022"></a>Release v0.2.2<a class="hash-link" href="#release-v022" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In early June we discovered that some searchers were gaming the Flashbots auction and underpaying miners for inclusion. The heart of the bug was that MEV-Geth did not ensure that the gas price that bundles paid post-merging was the same as what we thought it was pre-merge. Since bundles are simulated alone at the head of a block, if a bundle could somehow change the amount it paid based on their position in a block then that bundle could trick MEV-Geth if it was merged in the 2nd or later bundle position.</p><p>Given that this affected both searcher and miner’s profitability we pushed a fix in release v0.2.2 to this. The fix for this issue can be found <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/commit/ceab2ea57f8abf6499d001ef1052756541db4d41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="release-v023"></a>Release v0.2.3<a class="hash-link" href="#release-v023" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As part of the update to bundle scoring in release v0.2 we started to discount the fees from transactions that had been seen in the mempool in order to prevent “bundle stuffing,” where searchers take high gas price transactions from the mempool and include them in their bundles in order to “piggyback” off of those gas prices and get some transactions accepted that otherwise wouldn’t have been.</p><p>Our implementation of this discounting did fix bundle stuffing, but it also wrongly penalized a class of searchers who submit both transactions in the regular mempool and Flashbots transactions at the same time. Essentially we wrongly discounted coinbase payments from these transactions, which meant they landed in Flashbots blocks much less often than they should. The fix for this issue can be found <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth/commit/b74ae835e9356817ba60db3da39dc4ce81691ca1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="bundle-merging-highlights"></a>Bundle merging highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#bundle-merging-highlights" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Since bundle merging launched we can see a substantial increase in the number of bundles included in blocks. In fact the number of bundles more than doubled, going from ~6,000 to ~13,000 in the weeks after bundle merging was launched.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/transparency-may-june-1-90499d16c90f8fabb23a3a8140bc84c0.png"></p><p>Bundle merging saw strong and consistent adoption, reaching nearly ~70% of Flashbots blocks having 2 or more bundles included in them</p><p><img src="/assets/images/transparency-may-june-2-c27530ab0e57d35ec21a3f8fa6af5cdf.png"></p><p>In turn the amount of MEV that miners make per block has increased relative to normal transaction fees. The chart below shows average MEV profit divided by transaction fees, measured on a daily basis. This demonstrates that while the overall profitability of Flashbots blocks has been decreasing, that drop can be attributed to the decrease in gas prices recently and Flashbots is actually accounting for an increasing amount of miner’s revenue over time.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/transparency-may-june-3-a5c10da0c4fc832912a8243662f66da6.png"></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="eip1559"></a>EIP1559<a class="hash-link" href="#eip1559" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>With the London fork around the corner, the Flashbots team has shifted focus towards adding support for EIP-1559 to MEV-Geth and Flashbots Relay. Flashbots aims to have MEV-Geth v0.3 released at the end of June to support the Goerli upgrade to EIP-1559 on block 5062605: <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/06/18/london-testnets-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/06/18/london-testnets-announcement/</a></p><p>EIP-1559 has big implications for searchers and miners. Searchers will need to adapt their bots to use a new transaction format and will be required to pay the base_fee for each of their transactions. This means it is no longer possible to achieve “0 gas” transactions. We are hoping to introduce upgrades to ethereum and flashbots in the future which re-enable this behavior. On the miner’s side, EIP-1559 will have an impact on their accounting and node infrastructure. We expect EIP-1559 to further increase miner’s desire to receive value from MEV.</p><p>Flashbots Research is currently analyzing the impact of EIP-1559 on MEV and Flashbots. The preliminary results will be presented in MEV.wtf summit on Jul 1, followed by a research post.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="reputation"></a>Reputation<a class="hash-link" href="#reputation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We are starting to experiment with a reputation system to handle the load we have been receiving in periods of heavy activity — this should lead to improved relay performance for searchers with a history of successful inclusions. While we expect this change to have an immediate positive impact, it is a temporary solution and we are actively looking for feedback on how we should think about scaling the relay moving forward.

Our first research post on the topic was released <a href="https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/mev-in-eth2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, alongside a <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/eth2-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a> with some rough modeling of staking rewards with MEV. In this early exploration, we study transaction ordering in eth2 and analyze MEV-enabled staking yields. We find that MEV will significantly boost validator rewards but may reinforce inequalities within participants of eth2. We also discuss qualitative aspects of MEV in eth2 such as the potential dynamics that will unfold between its largest stakeholders like exchanges and validator pools.</p><p>This follows our joint prototyping experiment with Nethermind and Lido in ETHGlobal, <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/raytracing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Tracing</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="ongoing-research-efforts"></a>Ongoing research efforts:<a class="hash-link" href="#ongoing-research-efforts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are multiple ongoing research efforts worked on by Flashbots team members, external collaborators and MEV Fellows.
