Note: developers at this layer make decisions on behalf of their users on how to deal with MEV. One key decision they make is whether to route user transactions to a public transaction pool where they can be picked off by searchers indiscriminately, or to send them to a private routing system like ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview/"},"Flashbots Protect")," which restricts what searchers can do with the transactions.
