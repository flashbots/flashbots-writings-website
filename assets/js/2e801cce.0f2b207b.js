In Ethereum, over 90% of miners have adopted Flashbots; however, as we approach eth2 and the transition to PoS, adoption will reset to 0. As such, for the health of the Ethereum ecosystem, it is imperative that validators also adopt an MEV solution for Ethereum post-merge. To assist in this adoption, we are pleased to announce the Flashbots Eth2 Working Group.","date":"2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 30, 2021","tags":[{"label":"eth2","permalink":"/tags/eth-2"}],"readingTime":5.905,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Gosselin","title":"Architect @Flashbots","url":"https://twitter.com/thegostep","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1432425822707650565/bKxdVmeR_400x400.jpg","key":"thegostep"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Unity is Strength - A Formalization of Cross-Domain Maximal Extractable Value","permalink":"/cross-domain-mev"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ken Griffin and the MEV dystopia","permalink":"/ken-griffin-mev"}}},{"id":"ken-griffin-mev","metadata":{"permalink":"/ken-griffin-mev","source":"@site/content/2021-11-22-ken-griffin-mev.mdx","title":"Ken Griffin and the MEV dystopia","description":"Like many others, when I learned that Ken Griffith beat out 17k crypto frens at purchasing the copy of the constitution, I couldn\'t help but laugh.","date":"2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 22, 2021","tags":[{"label":"flashbots","permalink":"/tags/flashbots"}],"readingTime":1.64,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stephane Gosselin","title":"Architect @Flashbots","url":"https://twitter.com/thegostep","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1432425822707650565/bKxdVmeR_400x400.jpg","key":"thegostep"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing the Flashbots Eth2 Working Group","permalink":"/announcing-eth2-working-group"},"nextItem":{"title":"MEV-Boost -- Merge ready Flashbots Architecture","permalink":"/mev-boost"}}},{"id":"mev-boost","metadata":{"permalink":"/mev-boost","source":"@site/content/2021-11-03-mev-boost.mdx","title":"MEV-Boost -- Merge ready Flashbots Architecture","description":"This document outlines the design for a marketplace for block construction (often referred to as block proposer / block builder separation or PBS) compatible with the upcoming Ethereum merge fork.
